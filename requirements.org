* Build a webserver!
** Description

   Your task is to build a partially HTTP 1.1 compliant
   webserver. Your webserver will serve static content from the www
   directory in the same directory that you start the webserver in.

** User Stories
   - As a user I want to view files in ./www via a webbrowser
   - As a user I want to view files in ./www via curl
   - As a webserver admin I want to serve HTML and CSS files from ./www
   - As a webserver admin I want ONLY files in ./www and deeper to be
     served.

** Requirements
   - [ ] The webserver can serve files from ./www
   - [ ] The webserver can be run using the runner.sh file
   - [ ] The webserver can pass all the tests in freetests.py
   - [ ] The webserver can pass all the tests in not-free-tests.py
     (you don't have this one!)
   - [ ] The webserver supports mime-types for HTML
   - [ ] The webserver supports mime-types for CSS
   - [ ] The webserver can return index.html from directories (paths
     that end in /)
   - [ ] The webserver can server 404 errors for paths not found
   - [ ] The webserver works with Firefox and Chromium
     http://127.0.0.1:8080/
   - [ ] The webserver can serve CSS properly so that the front page
     has an orange h1 header.
   - [ ] I can check out the source code via git URL
